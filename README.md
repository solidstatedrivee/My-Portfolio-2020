# My Portfolio 2020
Decided to add a shiny to coat of paint to my old portfolio for this year! Take a look around! It highlights my education, work I have done for school, others, and personal projects. It also includes the super nice things other folks who I have worked with said about me. If you want to get to know me further, you can email me at nsims@ggc.edu
